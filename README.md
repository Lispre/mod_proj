# mod_proj
The project is used for formalize the project file initialized by the visual studio

Are you tired with set the folders and paths ... details in visual studio with mouse?

I am so tired with these stuff manually.

so I write this small tools

After I initialize an project with visual studio, I enter the project folder and run command as blow

>
>  mod_proj *.vcxproj
>

Then all configuration is formlized.
